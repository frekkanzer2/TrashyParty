## Future Minigames with lateral view
- Hunting Season (avoid hunter bullets)
- Eggs Kart (change lane to avoid incoming eggs)
- Eggy Treasure (collect the eggs that will spawn in the map and return them in the chest - the first one that deposits 10 eggs will win - it anyone stuns you, you lose the egg)

## Future Minigames with view from above
- Nuclear Bump (push the other birds into the nuclear liquid)
- Deadly Race (a player controls a car that always spins: by pressing a button, the car will move in the direction of the spin. If the other players do not get run over within one minute, the car will explode and they will win)
- Birdjammers (Windjammers-like game)
- Betrayer Bird (one player is the killer with a shotgun, that will kill every bird in 1 minute)
